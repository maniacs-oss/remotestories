          Anonymous stories from remote workers
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Remote Stories is a platform where remote workers of all kinds can anonymously post their experiences, thoughts, concerns, opinions and, of course, general ups/downs.

        <Paragraph>
          You can react to others posts with:
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph component="ul">
          <li>ðŸ˜„ Agree/Haha me too</li>
          <li>ðŸ˜° Shit that is scary/Iâ€™m worried about this too</li>
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Remote workers need to know they are not alone with their struggles. This platform lets you see what issues (good and bad) others are facing.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Feel free to discuss your thoughts on posts and learn from other peoples' experiences. Find out the true ins and outs of a remote life.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
